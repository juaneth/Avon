### -- Multipurpose project manager built in React and Tauri --
## Plan is:
- A) **Make a project manager for all my projects so I can run scripts to build and debug. Have a home for all my to-do lists and other assets and re-used packages and templates for new projects with similar stacks**
- B) **Learn Tauri and Rust along the way**
