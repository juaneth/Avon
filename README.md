### -- Multipurpose project manager built in React and Tauri --
## Plan is:
- A) **Make a project manager for all my projects so I can run scripts to build and debug. Have a home for all my to-do lists and other assets and re-used packages and templates for new projects with similar stacks**
- B) **Learn Tauri and Rust along the way**

Draggable and completely customisable layout with drag and drop "widgets"

### Planned widgets:
- Assets: Reuse global assets across all your projects and import them (eg. reused files, css classes etc.)
- Automation: Run scripts for building and packaging your project or write your own scripts to run functions
- Build: See your build config and build your project
- Collab: Invite other people to plan and collaborate with
- Dependancies: Shows all your projects dependancies in a simple lists with descriptions from NPM/Cargo etc.
- Git: Pretty self explanatory, shows your recent git pushes and issues/pull requests
- Hosting: Gonna make a server application to allow 1 click uploads to VPS's or your own servers
- Info: Shows info about your project
- Templater: Creates a template from your project and saves it so you can create new projects from that template
- Todo: Todo list for planning features
- Discord: Shows you a quick overview of your discord servers stats, maybe recent announcments if i'm feeling fancy
